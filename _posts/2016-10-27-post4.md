Recently, I met with my supervisor, Hadi Mehrpouya, for the first time, alongside other students whom were also assigned him as a supervisor. The meeting was a great help in both discussing our ideas for our projects and getting feedback, both from our supervisor and our peers on the project.

Unfortunately, having been suffering from a cold lately, I was actually unable to speak for the first half of the meeting, but even just listening to the ideas given was a great help, and I look forward to future meetings.
