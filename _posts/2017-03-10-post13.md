No massive developments in the past few weeks, with business as usual for the most part.

The execution is still on track for testing at the end of March, with all control schemes not implemented, that being the mouse and keyboard, game controller and dance pad and wii remote. All thats left is to ensure there are no bugs in the game and to create a few more levels for better results.

The dissertation is also progressing well, with both the Methodology and the Literature review nearing completion. Afterwards, I will need to wait for the results from the final study at the end of this month, before I can progress onto the Results and Discussion sections.
