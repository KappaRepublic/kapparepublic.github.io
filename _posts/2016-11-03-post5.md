This meeting saw discussions of the project proposal, and how best to work on it. In particular, splitting up the tasks that needed to be done between writing the proposal and working on our initial demonstration of our project.

After the meeting, using the feedback and discussions from the meeting, I continued work on creating my proposal and prototype.
