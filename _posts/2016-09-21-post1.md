To being my honour's project, I examined a few possible projects that I may be intereseted in pursuing over the year. One such project was examining how the use of different controllers can affect how a player experiences a game. Having had an interest in games from a young age and having seen many advancements in how games can be played, such as with the advent of motion controls, I have always wondered about the actual benefits these controls provided. Another possible project I am considering is that of dynamic difficulty in video games. What this means is creating a system that adjusts the difficulty of a game as the player goes through it, providing a much more personal difficulty to each payer than standard difficulty settings. If I were to follow through on this project, then it is likely I would examine what benefits these sorts of systems have when compared to more traditional ones.

Over the next few weeks, I plan to examine materials on both of these ideas, then come to a descision on what one to pursue.
