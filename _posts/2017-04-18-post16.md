With submission deadlines on the horizon, the next week will be the preperation for submissions. The execution is ready to submit now, and I plan to submit it a day or so before the deadline.

My dissertation is nearing completion, with several drafts completed and feedback from my supervisor to go over and examine any final changed I can make. Once that's finished, I will submit the dissertation, leaving only the final presentation for Honour's before I complete my 4th year of university.
