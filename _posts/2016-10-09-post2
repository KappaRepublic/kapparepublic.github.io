Over the past few weeks, in the workshops for honour's, we have been creating presentations to give to the rest of the workshop about our chosen projects.

I have decided to look into the effects of control schemes on player's enjoyment and engagement with games, in particular, control schemes making use of what I will be referring to as natural actions, i.e. control schemes that require the player to perform actions in real life similar to the actions performed in game. I have completed my presentation on the subject and will be giving it to the rest of the workshop in the coming weeks.
