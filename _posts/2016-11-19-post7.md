With the proposal finished and submitted, the next task I have been working on is development of the Feasibility Demo, due at the end of this semester.

My plans for the demo are to create a small variety of minigames, around 3 at the most, each displaying the use of a different control scheme. I have chosen to build a game based on the mouse and keyboard, the wii remotes motion sensors and a dance pad.

Over the next few weeks, I plan to develop these minigames in order to best show off how I could use each control scheme.
