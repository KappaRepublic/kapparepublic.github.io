Over the past week, I have had a total of 22 participants take part in my study, a number I am very happy with.

Each participant played the application with each control scheme and then filled in a questionnaire about their experiences. Over the next few days, I plan to go over this data and compile it for use in my dissertation. From then on, I plan to write up the results section of my dissertation and then move onto the discussion of the results.

The testing itself provided very positive and useful feedback and will make writing the next few sections of my dissertation much simpler, due to the enthuasism of the participants.
