Having has my birthday over the past weekend, as well as my brother's fiances birthday, I went home in order to celebrate the two, so most of the work from this week was done whilst I was still up in Dundee, wondering where literally everyone of my flatmates had gotten to.

Anyway, both the keyboard and mouse and the dance pad game have now been completed. The keyboard and mouse game is a simple point and click shooting gallery game just showing how such a control scheme could be used. The dance pad game was a dodging game where the player must use the directions on the pad to dodge all incoming obstacled.

Next, I plan to work on the wii remote game. I plan to make it a sorting game, where the player moves the wii remote in reality to control some sort of machanism in game for sorting coloured objects. I plan to make use of this plugin for wii remote inclusion in Unity: https://github.com/Flafla2/Unity-Wiimote, as creating the interface from the bottom up would be far too time consuming to do.
