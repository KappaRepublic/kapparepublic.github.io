The questionnaire I plan to use in the final study has now been completed, and takes into account the findings of the pilot study. The study itself has been set for the next few weeks and I have managed to gather a few willing participants already. My hope is to hit around 20 participants for the study, and between those willing in Dundee and those back home, I believe this is not too far a goal to achieve.
