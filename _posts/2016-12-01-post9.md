The feasibility demo has been completed and is now ready for submission. As my supervisor will be on paternity leave for the next few weeks, it's unclear when I'll actually be presenting the demo to him. It's possible we may be able to do so over Skype, however, I am visiting family over the christmas break and will unlikely be available to do so. In most likelihood, I'll be giving my presentation after the Christmas break has ended.

For now, I'm going to make any final checks I need to for the demo and make sure everythings properly ready for submission. As I stated, since I'll be visiting familiy over christmas, it's unlikely I'll get a lot of progress done over the coming break, but once we come back, it's on to the dissertation and project execution for real.
