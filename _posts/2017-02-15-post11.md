Over the past few weeks, I have been continuing research and meetings with my supervisor. Meetings have changed from Thursdays to Tuesdays and are now done in pairs instead of the whole group, meaning Hadi is able to give more time to each individual person, whilst also having peer feedback avaialable.

Progress on the execution has also been moving onward. I have created a basic First Person Shooter game which is controlled via the mouse and keyboard. I plan for the game to be playable with both a game controller and mouse and keyboard as well.

In order to best ascertain what I should do at the data gathering stage of the project, I have decided to run a short pilot study at the end of this month, using the currently created application with some modifications in order to see what the best questions to ask each participant of the study would be, as well as to see if there's anything obvious I've missed in the execution itself.
