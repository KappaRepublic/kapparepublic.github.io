Over the past weekend, I conducted and completed a short pilot study with a few participants, as detailed in the last post.

The findings from this study have been invaluable and helped immensely with how I plan to conduct the final study. I have added the information gathered into my dissertation as well, adding to the Methodology section.

In general, the questions asked in the study were relevant and it became clear that what I planned to ask in the final study only needed refining, not overhauled completely.

Over the next few weeks, I plan to continue forward with my execution and dissertation, which are both proceeding smoothly. I have set a tentative deadline for my final study at the end of March, and all going well, my execution should be completely ready for then.
